hi im a trans gay guy who likes anime guys and has fat social anxiety

pls don't start drama with me i dont handle it well

i might have bpd but until i take a proper diagnosis take it with a grain of salt i dont wanna be seen as a self-diagnoser and also i make freaky jokes... i can also sound a bit blunt and mean but i swear i bear no ill intent

i like varka, columbina, flins and madoka and i ship madohomu, flinvarka, sandrina and flineffa

tbh i just ship my fave characters even if they never spoke to eachother (as long as its not toxic or a proship ofc)

---

interests: genshin, hsr, vocaloid, prsk, hetalia, serial experiments lain, puella magi madoka magica, to your eternity, persona 5 (didn't finish it yet though), bayonetta


dni: basic dni, trump supporters, proshippers, fujoshits (and also people that hate straight ships ur so corny) and under 16... other than that i block freely so just don't be a weirdo

systems are on thin ice
