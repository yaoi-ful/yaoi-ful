hi im a trans gay guy who likes anime guys and has fat social anxiety

pls don't start drama with me i dont handle it well

i might have bpd but until i take a proper diagnosis take it with a grain of salt i dont wanna be seen as a self-diagnoser and also i make freaky jokes... i can also sound a bit blunt and mean but i swear i bear no ill intent

i like varka, columbina, flins and madoka and i ship madohomu, flinvarka, sandrina and flineffa

tbh i just ship my fave characters even if they never spoke to eachother (as long as its not toxic or a proship ofc)
